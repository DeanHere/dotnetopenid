Curious what's changed from version to version?  Wonder if it's worth upgrading or what breaking changes may exist?  This is the page for you.  
Not all fixed issues are listed here, but the more noteworthy ones are.  Unless explicitly said otherwise, each version has all the enhancements of the previously listed ones.

== Version 2.1 (unreleased) ==
  * *Planned:* Support for OpenID extensions that do not require authentication to be occurring at all.
  * *Planned:* Add built-in support for [http://openid.net/specs/openid-attribute-exchange-1_0.html Attribute Exchange] and [http://openid.net/specs/openid-provider-authentication-policy-extension-1_0-01.html PAPE] extensions.

== Version 2.0 (unreleased) ==
_Timeline: April 2008_
  * Added support for *OpenID 2.0 Relying Parties and Providers*, including but not limited to these features:
    * Xri and i-name support
    * Directed identity support
    * More secure hashing algorithms (SHA-256)
    * Interop with Yahoo and other OpenID 2.0-only providers
    * Better security against replay attacks.
  * *Planned:* Much more comprehensive testing of common scenarios and possible security exploits.
  * More comprehensive HTML-based identity discovery.
  * _Completely_ stateless mode supported for Relying Parties (not even !HttpApplication state).

== Version 1.0.1 ==
  * Fixed Provider bug where all issued associations lasted only one minute.  This has no impact on sites only using Relying Party functionality in the library.

== Version 1.0.0 ==
  * Added replay attack detection and prevention.  (issue 40)
  * Fixed `MemoryStore` caching where ASP.NET could freely clear out keys in the middle of an authentication causing random failures.  (issue 16)
  * _Heavy_ refactoring to follow more .NET conventions, be easier to 'discover' with 
  * Most classes now belong to the new `DotNetOpenId` namespace.  
  * Two new ASP.NET controls to make hosting OpenID providers or identity forwarders easier.
  * `OpenIdTextBox.ShowLogo` property now defaults to true.
  * !ProviderPortal sample web site's urlrewrite section moved outside of system.web.  (issue 38)
  * Many more unit tests for more comprehensive coverage of code and scenarios.  Lots of little bugs fixed.

== Version 0.1.2 ==
  * Session state is no longer required for consumers.  (issue 37)
  * *Partial trust* scenarios now supported.  Unsafe C# code rewritten in safe code so shared-hosting ASP.NET web sites can now be OpenID providers/consumers.  (issue 14)
  * Fixed intermittent authentication failure due to indeterministic signature verification.  (issue 47)

== Version 0.1.1 ==
  * Added `OpenIdTextBox.ShowLogo` property to easily show OpenID logo from embedded resource. (issue 25)
  * Added a Remember Me checkbox to the `OpenIdLogin` control.  (issue 32)
  * Added `OpenIdLogin.RegisterVisible` property.
  * Fixed UTC/Local `DateTime` inconsistent usage.  (issue 18)
  * Fixed bug where one of `CheckIdRequest`'s constructors would always fail due to passing `Uri.AbsolutePath` to `TrustRoot`'s constructor.  (issue 35)
  * Improved security by adding `TrustRoot` validation that was missing from earlier versions.
  * Added `OpenIdTextBox.TrustRootUrl` property.  (issue 39)

== Version 0.1.0 ==
  * Fixed bug where only the first LINK tag in an HTML document would be parsed for openid.server information. (issue 15)
  * Fixed `OpenIdTextBox` bug where old failure cases would cause all future cases to fail as well. (issue 17)
  * `OpenIdTextBox` now catches some failure exceptions and fires the Error event as appropriate. (issue 19)
  * Removed requirement for `http://` to precede the host in the `OpenIdLogin` control. (issue 25)

== Version M1 ==
  * First release of a working library.  
  * Full support for OpenID 1.1 consumers and providers.
  * Easy to use ASP.NET controls for OpenID consumers.
