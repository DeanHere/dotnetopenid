  * First release of a working library.  
  * Full support for OpenID 1.1 consumers and providers.

== Version 0.1 ==
  * Fixed bug where only the first LINK tag in an HTML document would be parsed for openid.server information. (issue 15)
  * Fixed `OpenIdTextBox` bug where old failure cases would cause all future cases to fail as well. (issue 17)
  * `OpenIdTextBox` now catches some failure exceptions and fires the Error event as appropriate. (issue 19)
  * Removed requirement for `http://` to precede the host in the `OpenIdLogin` control. (issue 25)

== Version 0.1.1 ==
  * Added `OpenIdTextBox.ShowLogo` property to easily show OpenID logo from embedded resource. (issue 25)

  * Fixed UTC/Local `DateTime` inconsistent usage.  (issue 18)

== Version 0.1.2 (unreleased) ==
  * Session state is no longer required for consumers.  (issue 37)
  * _Planned_: *Partial trust* scenarios now supported.  Unsafe C# code rewritten in safe code so shared-hosting ASP.NET web sites can now be OpenID providers/consumers.

  * *Partial trust* scenarios now supported.  Unsafe C# code rewritten in safe code so shared-hosting ASP.NET web sites can now be OpenID providers/consumers.
  * Fixed `MemoryStore` caching where ASP.NET could freely clear out nonces in the middle of an authentication causing random failures.  (issue 16)
  * Refactored to follow more .NET conventions.  
  * Most classes now belong to the new `DotNetOpenId` namespace.  
  * Most custom exception classes renamed to end with `Exception`.
  * `OpenIdTextBox.ShowLogo` property now defaults to true.
  * ProviderPortal sample web site's urlrewrite section moved outside of system.web.  (issue 38)
