/// It is the responsibility of the consumer to redirect the user to this url.
/// 
/// The XRDS (or Yadis) content is also rendered to provide the consumer with an alternative discovery mechanism. The Yadis protocol allows the consumer 
/// to provide the user with a more flexible range of authentication mechanisms (which ever has been defined in xrds.aspx). See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yadis.
